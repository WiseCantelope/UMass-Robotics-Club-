    <h1>Welcome to the UMass Robotics Club</h1>

    <p>
      The UMass Robotics Club is a welcoming space for all students—no matter their
      major or experience level—to explore the world of robotics. Our projects are
      hands-on and cross-disciplinary, giving members opportunities to dive into
      mechanical design, software development, electronics, and artistic avenues
      that go into building robots.
    </p>

    <p>
      Along the way, students sharpen critical thinking skills and gain practical
      experience that translates directly into careers and everyday problem-solving.
      Whether you’re in the College of Engineering, CICS, or simply curious about
      robotics, the club is an incredible way to apply classroom knowledge, build
      new skills, and connect with peers who share your interests.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’re proud to be a College of Engineering JSES, a CICS club, and an official RSO.
    </p>

    <h2>This Year’s Teams</h2>

      <h3>Research Team</h3>
      <p>
        In partnership with the Dynamic & Autonomous Robotics Systems Lab, the
        Research Team is tackling the challenge of designing a lightweight quadruped
        robot. This modular platform advances members’ knowledge of robotics while
        contributing to ongoing campus research.

      <h3>Ant Weight BattleBot Competition</h3>
      <p>
        This beginner-friendly project invites students of all skill levels to design,
        build, and compete with their own small-scale battle bots. Supported by CICS,
        the competition provides starter kits, workshops, and access to a
        competition-grade arena.
