      <h2>A Message from Our Presidents</h2>
      <div class="card"><p style="font-size: 15px;"> 
          <b>Dear future supporters,</b>
          <br>
          <br> Our mission is to create a welcoming space for all students—no matter their major or experience level—to explore the world of robotics.
          <br>
          <br> Our club brings together students from engineering, computer science, and beyond to explore robotics through hands-on projects. We're a community of makers and innovators who believe that the best learning happens when you turn ideas into real, functional machines.
          <br>
          <br> Your sponsorship invests in the next generation of roboticists and engineers. It creates opportunities for students to experiment, fail, learn, and ultimately succeed in ways that will shape their careers and our industry.
          <br>
          <br> We hope you'll join us in building a future where innovation, education, and collaboration drive everything we do. 
          <br>
          <br> Thank you,
          <br> Kira Seggerty
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; UMR President
          <br> Liam Curry
          <br> &nbsp;&nbsp; UMR Vice-President
