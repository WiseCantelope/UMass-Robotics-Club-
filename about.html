      <h1>Our Mission</h1>

      <p class="mission-text">
        The UMass Robotics Club exists to create an inclusive,
        hands-on environment where students of all majors and
        experience levels can explore robotics. We aim to bridge
        theory and practice through collaborative engineering,
        research partnerships, and competitive builds that
        challenge members to grow technically and professionally.
